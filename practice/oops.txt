1. Encapsulation – Student Report Card System
=============================================
Problem:
	Create a class Student where all data must be protected so that no one can modify it directly.

Requirements:
	Private fields: name, rollNumber, marks

	Provide public getters/setters

	When setting marks, ensure:

	Marks must be between 0 and 100

	If invalid, print: "Invalid Marks"

	Add a method printDetails() to show all student details

2. Inheritance – College Member System
======================================
Problem:
	A college has Teachers and Students, and both share common details.

Requirements:
	Base class: Person

	Fields: name, age

	Methods: showBasicDetails()

	Class 1: Student extends Person

	Fields: rollNumber, course

	Method: showStudentDetails()

	Class 2: Teacher extends Person

	Fields: employeeId, subject

	Method: showTeacherDetails()

Task:
	Create one Student object and one Teacher object

	Call all methods and observe inheritance


3. Method Overloading – Math Helper Utility
===========================================
Problem:
	You must create a Math utility class that supports different types of addition.

Requirements:
	Create class MathHelper with overloaded add() methods:

	add(int a, int b)

	add(double a, double b)

	add(int a, int b, int c)

Task:
	Create object → call all versions

	Print results


4. Method Overriding – Animal Sound Program
===========================================
Problem:
	Different animals make different sounds.
	Use overriding to show this.

Requirements:
	Base Class: Animal

	Method: sound() → print "Animal makes sound"

	Subclasses:

	Dog → print "Dog barks"

	Cat → print "Cat meows"

	Cow → print "Cow moos"

Task:
	Create an array Animal[] animals = {new Dog(), new Cat(), new Cow()}

	Loop and call sound() on each

5. Abstraction Using Abstract Class – Online Payment System
===========================================================
Problem:
	You must design different payment methods but keep a common rule.

Requirements:

	Abstract Class: Payment

	abstract method: pay(double amount)

	normal method: displayMessage()

	Subclasses:

	CreditCardPayment → print "Paid using Credit Card"

	UPIPayment → print "Paid using UPI"

Task:

	Use Payment reference pointing to different child objects
	Example: Payment p = new CreditCardPayment();

	Call pay(5000)


6. Interface – Music Player
===========================
Problem:
	Create a music player system where various instruments can be played.

Requirements:

	Interface: Playable

	method: play()

	Classes:

	Guitar → "Playing Guitar"

	Piano → "Playing Piano"

	Drum → "Playing Drum"

Task:

	Create objects of all instruments

	Call play()

7. super Keyword – Parent → Child Construction
==============================================
Problem:
	Understand how parent constructor gets called before child.

Requirements:
	Parent Class: Vehicle

	Constructor → print "Vehicle is created"

	Child Class: Car

	Constructor → print "Car is created"
	Use super() to call parent

Task:
	Create Car object and observe output order


8. this Keyword – Variable Confusion Problem
============================================
Problem:
	Sometimes parameter names and instance variable names are the same.

Requirement:
	Create Employee class with field: salary
	Constructor: Employee(int salary)

	Inside constructor use:

	this.salary = salary;


Task:
	Create object and print salary


9. Constructor Chaining – Car Info System
=========================================
Problem:
	Create 3 constructors for Car class.

Requirements:
	Constructor 1: no args → "Basic Car"
	Constructor 2: one arg (model)
	Constructor 3: two args (model, price)

	Use this() to chain all constructors.

Task:

	Create an object with 2 arguments

	Observe constructor order

10. Has-A Relationship – Student Has Address
============================================
Problem:
	A student has an address.
	Use composition.

	Class Address

	Fields: street, city, pincode

	Class Student

	Fields: name, roll
	Field: Address address
	Constructor should take an Address object

Task:
	Create Address object

	Pass it to Student

	Print full details

11. Static Keyword – Count Number of Objects
============================================
Problem:
	Every time an object is created, a counter should increase.

Requirements:
	Class Counter

	Static variable: count

	Increment it inside constructor

	Make method showCount()

Task:

	Create 3 objects

	Print the count

12. final Keyword – Prevent Modification
========================================
Problem:
	Create a class where values should not change.

Requirements:

	final variable: PI = 3.14

	final method display() that prints PI

	Try to override (should give error)
